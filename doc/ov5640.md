# OV5640 compatibility issues

AVDD - analog circuit power, 2.8V.

DOVDD - IO circuit power, can be 1.8V or 2.8.V. With ESP32, we use 2.8V.

DVDD - digital circuit power, 1.5V.  It can be powered from external power supply or from internal regulator.

Since many boards are designed for OV2640 which has DVDD 1.2V, esp32-camera library configures ov5640 to use internal linear regulator.
As specified in datasheet, it produces a lot of heat, unfortunatelly. Theoretically it should be possible to decrease heating by adding external 1.5V power supply.

Note that one of the datasheets below specify DVDD as 1.2V incorrectly. it should be 1.5V for ov5640.

AF-VCC is autofocus motor power, 2.8V. Autofocus moter is controlled thought i2C bus.

AF-GND and AF-VCC may be switched on some camera modules. Note that on XIAO esp32s3 expansion board pin 24 is connected to 2.8V. If camera has AF-GND on this pin, then there will be shoort circuit. 
Examine ov5640 ribbon cable before connecting it to XIAO. If pin 24 is connected to GND, simply cut it with a sharp knife.
